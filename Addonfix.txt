Installing webIDE

Download firefox v59 (before installing make sure the previous version of firefox is uninstalled) 
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/59.0/win64/en-US/

I would also suggest disabling auto updates once Firefox is installed
Menu > options > general
 

Add this addon 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disabled-add-on-fix-57-60/
Once everything is installed
•	in Firefox go to Tools > Web Developer >WebIDE
•	on right should see “USB Devices” and should have one device 
•	on the left have “Open Packaged App” – click it, and choose some app (a folder) 
•	middle top click the play button… that’s it, app should be on your phone and you should notice it.
